# machine_learning1.2
A linear regression project based on very important "Learning To Rank problem.". There are two solutions in this project. 
1. Closed form solution.
2. Gradient descent solution
Both the solutions use radial gaussian basis functions to reduce dimentionality as well as introduce non- linearity in the linear regression.
The objective of this project is to Rank the given data-which consist of input values x and target values t. Each input value consists of 46 feature vectors. These 46 features may include domain, word matches, heading matches, page popularity, traffic on the page, time taken by user to stay on the page, compatibility of the page on phones and tablets etc. These features are extracted from the dataset and then given to the LeToR model for calculating the weights associated with each feature.
